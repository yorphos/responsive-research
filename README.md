# Researching Responsive Design!!!

We are mixing it up with:
- React (create-react-app)
- Typescript
- Bootstrap
- Sass
- & more to come :)

## What are we trying to get done?

The world of web development has rocked my understanding of reality and the flimsy constructs we trust in every day.
The purpose of the Researching Responsive Design (RRD) project is to develop a foundationa, well-rounded understanding of responsive layout design and implementation. The goal is to study a multitude of approaches and habits, and cultivate an informed basis to take going into future projects.
The end result will hopefully be a responsive website to then integrate with firebase for a future project.
